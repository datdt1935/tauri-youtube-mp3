# Placeholder files - replace with actual binaries before building for distribution
# These empty files allow the build to succeed, but you MUST replace them with real binaries

*.exe
yt-dlp
ffmpeg

# Keep this .gitignore but add actual binaries when ready
# The build will work with placeholders, but the app will fail at runtime if binaries are missing
